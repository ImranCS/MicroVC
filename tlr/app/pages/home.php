        The cottage - A two bedroom cottage with two bathrooms (for those diffident about bathing in the river), a
        private loft and equipped with a quaint chimney.
      </p>
      <p>
        We can accommodate over 40 people with tents which are pitched just outside the cottage. Adjoining we have
        three showers and three toilets for the people using these tents.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is at 913 metres (about 3000 ft) above sea level hence the weather is pleasant through the year. It is
        almost the same altitude as Bangalore, although the lush vegetation makes it much cooler. The monsoon, unlike
        in other parts of Coorg, is interspersed with a lot of sunshine.
