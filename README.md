MicroVC
=======
The smallest MVC framework ever. So small, there is not even a model.
Like Yii, there can be multiple apps running the same codebase.
Each app can have its own set of functions that are autoloaded.

Framework
----------
Files: Bootstrap, Controller Base, Functions, View Functions and an optional db.

See: https://github.com/ImranCS/MicroVC/wiki/framework

Application
-------------
Files: .htaccess, index
Protected: actions, config, views (template, page, edit), navigation and custom functions.

Use singlemodule and configure a bucketaction when all pages require the same action only.

Edit pages dynamically from the ui.
